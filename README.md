# churchgroup
*A small web app created for a small church community*

---

I created this web app atleast 2 years ago, so keep in mind that it does not represent my coding capabilities today, I just want to have it here for reference

You can see a live version at [projects.georgakopoulos.me](http://projects.georgakopoulos.me/churchgroup/)  
In order to test the functionality of this application you'll have to log in as an administrator with the credentials that are provided on the bottom of the login screen
