*A small web app created for a small church community*

---

I created this web app atleast 2 years ago, so keep in mind that it does not represent my coding capabilities today, I just want to have it here for reference

Live demo not available for this project, because it uses the depreciated mysql_ functions that are no longer supported in my server.

If you would like to check the functionality on your own server (*locally (XAMPP still supports mysql_)*), in order to be able to login, you have to register an account, and then go to the 'users' table in the database and make the columns 'is_active' and 'is_admin' **= 1**

*Thanks for understanding the fact that I've built this a long time ago, and so there are a lot of imperfections and bad practices have been used.*
